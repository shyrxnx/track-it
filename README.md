# Track-It

**Track-It** is a web-based habit tracker that helps users build and maintain daily routines with insightful analytics and progress tracking.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (LTS version recommended)
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** (optional, but recommended for cloning the repository)

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## 📦 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shyrxnx/track-it.git
cd track-it
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the app locally with:
